# ðŸš– Goodcabs Performance Analysis â€“ SQL, Excel & Power BI

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Goodcabs is a rising cab service provider that has carved a niche in Indiaâ€™s tier-2 cities. With a vision to support local drivers and ensure high-quality service to passengers, the company now operates across 10 cities and has set ambitious performance goals for 2024.

To align with these goals, the management team wanted a comprehensive analysis of key metrics, including:

- Trip volume  
- Passenger satisfaction  
- Repeat passenger rate  
- Trip distribution trends  
- New vs. repeat passenger contribution  

With the analytics manager engaged in another assignment, the responsibility was handed to Peter Pandey â€” a curious and detail-driven data analyst. Using tools like **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, this project explores data-driven answers to core business questions and presents insights to help leadership make informed decisions.

#### 2. Trip Analysis
![Trip Analysis Dashboard](Dashboard/Images/Trip%20Analysis.png)

The **Trip Analysis Dashboard** dives deeper into travel behaviors and city-level performance.

We begin with a visual showing the **frequency of repeat passenger trips** â€” uncovering how often passengers return, from 2 trips to 10 trips. This helps identify loyalty trends across cities.

Next, we have a comparison of **actual vs. target passenger ratings by city**, highlighting where service expectations are being met â€” and where improvements are needed.

Finally, a vibrant **ribbon chart** reveals the **demand distribution across weekdays and weekends**, segmented by city. This visualization captures shifting travel patterns and helps in planning staffing and operations accordingly.

This page unpacks the rhythm of trips and the pulse of customer satisfaction.

### ðŸ“Š Repeat Passenger Rate & Trip Analysis

![Repeat Passenger Rate and Trip Analysis](Dashboard/Images/RPR%20&%20Trip%20Insights.png)

This section focuses on understanding passenger loyalty and evaluating how well cities are meeting their trip targets.

It starts by highlighting the **Repeat Passenger Rate (%)** across cities and months, providing a clear picture of customer retention trends. The dashboard also shows **Total Passengers by Month**, helping to track overall demand patterns over time.

To assess performance, the dashboard includes a visual comparison of **Trips Against Targets by City**, showing both actual numbers and target benchmarks. Additionally, the **Trip Target Difference (%)** is shown to measure how much each city exceeded or missed its goal.

Together, these insights help identify cities with strong repeat passenger behavior and evaluate which ones are performing well operationally.

This sheet provides both strategic and operational visibility, helping stakeholders quickly identify where to double down or take corrective actions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact

This project provides data-backed insights that can significantly support strategic decision-making across different functional teams:

- **City-Level Strategy**: By identifying the top and bottom performing cities in terms of passenger volume and repeat rates, regional teams can focus their efforts on scaling high-potential areas and improving underperforming locations.

- **Performance Benchmarking**: The analysis comparing actual vs. target metrics (for both trips and passenger ratings) gives a clear picture of where expectations are being met and where thereâ€™s a need for intervention or new strategies.

- **Repeat Behavior Monitoring**: Repeat passenger trends broken down by frequency and city help retention teams understand customer loyalty. This can drive marketing campaigns, reward programs, and operational focus toward improving ride experience.

- **Fare Optimization**: Metrics such as average fare per kilometer and trip distance give financial insights that can guide pricing strategies and route optimization, ensuring both profitability and customer satisfaction.

- **Operational Efficiency**: Visuals like the demand variation between weekdays and weekends can assist in workforce allocation, shift planning, and overall service readiness.

Together, these insights equip decision-makers with actionable intelligence to optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and align team efforts toward achieving business targets.
