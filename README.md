# ðŸš– Goodcabs Performance Analysis â€“ SQL, Excel & Power BI

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Goodcabs is a rising cab service provider that has carved a niche in Indiaâ€™s tier-2 cities. With a vision to support local drivers and ensure high-quality service to passengers, the company now operates across 10 cities and has set ambitious performance goals for 2024.

To align with these goals, the management team wanted a comprehensive analysis of key metrics, including:

- Trip volume  
- Passenger satisfaction  
- Repeat passenger rate  
- Trip distribution trends  
- New vs. repeat passenger contribution  

With the analytics manager engaged in another assignment, the responsibility was handed to Peter Pandey â€” a curious and detail-driven data analyst.

The **Trip Analysis Dashboard** dives deeper into travel behaviors and city-level performance.

We begin with a visual showing the **frequency of repeat passenger trips** â€” uncovering how often passengers return, from 2 trips to 10 trips. This helps identify loyalty trends across cities.

Next, we have a comparison of **actual vs. target passenger ratings by city**, highlighting where service expectations are being met â€” and where improvements are needed.

Finally, a vibrant **ribbon chart** reveals the **demand distribution across weekdays and weekends**, segmented by city. This visualization captures shifting travel patterns and helps in planning staffing and operations accordingly.

This page unpacks the rhythm of trips and the pulse of customer satisfaction.
