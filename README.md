# ðŸš– Goodcabs Performance Analysis â€“ SQL, Excel & Power BI

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Goodcabs is a rising cab service provider that has carved a niche in Indiaâ€™s tier-2 cities. With a vision to support local drivers and ensure high-quality service to passengers, the company now operates across 10 cities and has set ambitious performance goals for 2024.

To align with these goals, the management team wanted a comprehensive analysis of key metrics, including:

- Trip volume  
- Passenger satisfaction  
- Repeat passenger rate  
- Trip distribution trends  
- New vs. repeat passenger contribution  

With the analytics manager engaged in another assignment, the responsibility was handed to Peter Pandey â€” a curious and detail-driven data analyst. Using tools like **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, this project explores data-driven answers to core business questions and presents insights to help leadership make informed decisions.
